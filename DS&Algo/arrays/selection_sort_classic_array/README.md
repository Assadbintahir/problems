### Selection Sort
Selection sort is another sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2). Idea is to compare each element of the array with the lowest element of each pass through. 

### Selection sort vs bubble sort
Although when we express complexity of bubble sort and selection sort in terms of Big O, we find that both are O(n^2). But in reality, bubble sort is twice slow as selection sort. Since we ignore constants when looking at Big O, it becomes O(n^2).

When two algorithms fall under the same classification of Big O, it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that both algorithms have the same speed. After all, Bubble Sort is twice as slow as Selection Sort even though both are O(N2). So, while Big O is perfect for contrasting algorithms that fall under different classifications of Big O, when two algorithms fall under the same classification, further analysis is required to determine which algorithm is faster.
