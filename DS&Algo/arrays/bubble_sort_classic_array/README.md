### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is an expensive algorithm to sort a classic array. The idea is that we pick one element of array and compare to the rest of the elements of array, and along the way we keep on doing shift operations on the basis of those comparison. After the first *pass-through* (iteration), one element which is maximum bubbles out to the end of the array. Hence in the next pass-through, we do compare and shift for one less element.
